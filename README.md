# COVID19CXr_dataset

COVID19CXr dataset has created with the combination and modification of three publicly available datasets [1,2,3]. It consist 3040 chest X-ray images of 1930 patients.  In which, 546 images of 332 patients of COVID-19 class have included from the two publicly available repositories: [Figure 1 covid-19 chest x-ray data initiative](https://github.com/agchung/Figure1-COVID-chestxray-dataset)  and [Covid-19 image data collection](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset). 1139 images of 1015 patients of Normal class and 1355 images of 583 patients of Pneumonia class are included from the [Mendeley data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2).
